    "Place **\"hw1.py\"** python file in a directory of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the input file named **\"input.txt\"** in the same directory as **\"hw1.py\"** .\n",

    "\n",
    "On Windows: Press **\"Windows + R\"** keys, type cmd, and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS: Press **\"Cmd + Space\"** , type terminal, and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux: Depending on the distro, you can use shortcuts or search for the terminal in the application menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3) Navigate to the Directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the cd command followed by the directory path where you've saved hw1.py to navigate to the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd path_to_directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4) Run the Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the correct directory, type the following command to execute the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python hw1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5) Check the Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the script, an **\"output.txt\"** file will be generated in the same directory as the hw1.py script.\n",
